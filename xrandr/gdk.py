# Python-XRandR provides a high level API for the XRandR extension of the
# X.org server. XRandR allows to configure resolution, refresh rate, rotation 
# of the screen and multiple outputs of graphics cards.
#
# This module allows to get information for gtk.gdk.Screen objects
#
# In many aspects it follows the design of the xrand tool written by
# Keith Packard.
