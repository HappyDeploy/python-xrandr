Python-xrandr provides so called bindings for the xrandr extenstion of X.org,
the graphical base system found in most Linux and Unix systems. It is written
as a subproject of displayconfig-gtk and guidance, both graphical tools to
configure your screens and graphics.

Xrandr allows you to set the resolution and refresh rate of your monitor on the
fly. In the latest version 1.2 you can even configure multiple monitors 
instantly by merging or cloning monitors.

Currently only a subset of these capabilites are supported by python-xrandr.

The included command line tool pyxrandr shows you the detected devices and 
allows you to change the resolution, refresh rate and orientation or to 
disable an output.

Help on this project is always welcome. Feel free to contact us for questions
or comments.

The project is registered at Launchpad.net, a free (not as in beer) service 
infrastructure for Open Source software development hosted by Canonical, Ltd.

Errors (so called bugs) and problems can be reported here:
